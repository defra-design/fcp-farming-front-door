      Why we explored document upload
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      'Document upload' is a way for external users (like farmers and agents) to send files through the digital service
      to internal users (RPA customer service staff) to support:
    </p>


    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>claims for grants and funding</li>
      <li>complaints, appeals and updates to business records</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      A document upload feature has been agreed with Rural Payments Agency (RPA) as one of the first things we need to
      deliver, because there is a strong business need for it.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Document upload is not currently available as part of the Rural Payments service (RPS). Farmers and agents need to
      send a document through the post or by email, which customer service staff have to triage manually - a
      time-consuming and resource-heavy process.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If internal users could get documents automatically tagged and categorised as part of the upload process, this
      should reduce the amount of time and money staff spend manually triaging documents sent via email, and dealing
      with related phone calls, for example to check the document in the email was received.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      RPA’s Improving Customer Experience (ICE) team is already developing their own prototype for doc upload, and has
      decided requirements for that.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Constraints and brief
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The brief was to focus on what is possible to deliver in a short term MVP, rather than freely exploring long term
      transformation.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Due to the short term nature of our scope, we were asked to use the RPA’s existing technical requirements and
      processes. This includes a categorisation matrix for the ICE doc uploader prototype, a spreadsheet which shows
      what tags are needed in order to auto-triage documents and get them to the relevant customer service team. For
      example, the tags show whether a document is for a particular funding grant or scheme or a complaint or appeal, or
      whether it’s evidence or declaration, and depending on the combination of tags, the document lands in the right
      queue for staff to work on.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We were asked to design a standalone doc upload feature in the first instance, more like a proof of concept than
      part of an end-to-end journey. Initially, doc upload will not be integrated into claim journeys. This lack of
      end-to-end integration, and the inherent limitations of the current categorisation matrix and CRM, mean this
      limited initial design risks not meeting the needs of external users.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      <i>
        'Concerns raised over what happens if someone logs a document under the wrong category, or the category isn’t
        there. Make it clear what categories are available without the lists being overwhelming. Ensure there is a route
        for people to follow if a drop-down menu doesn’t include the item they need. Would it be possible to submit
        evidence when submitting a claim, rather than having to come out of the claim page and go to upload a document.
        Please make steps as simple as possible to avoid customers getting lost between pages/processes.'
      </i>
      <br>[Recommendation from RPA’s Customer Insight Team from interviews with 22 farmers, March 2025]
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      However, for the business, a standalone feature is only the first step in a long term transformation plan.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      RPA preferred that users should not be able to remove successfully uploaded documents via the online service (due
      to fraud risk).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      RPA also preferred not to allow an ‘other’ category of any kind, due to concerns most users would default to
      selecting this.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Pain points and user needs
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      RPA shared with us the feedback they got from farmers and agents on their prototype, and discussed the
      difficulties for staff with the current system, all of which was extremely helpful. We were able to use this to
      guide our design decisions.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Pain points for staff (internal) users include:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        manually attaching tags for triage
      </li>
      <li>
        having to sift through irrelevant files (like embedded images from an email signature) to find the ‘right’ files
      </li>
      <li>
        dealing with calls just to confirm a document was received
      </li>
      <li>
        processing documents sent ad hoc
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Pain points for external users include:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        lack of confirmation they have sent in a specific thing
      </li>
      <li>
        having to input too many categorisation details
      </li>
      <li>
        losing track of what you have sent in and when
      </li>
      <li>
        not being clear on what should be submitted
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Our user researcher identified the following user needs for external users:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        to be able to send any documents requested to RPA
      </li>
      <li>
        a fast way to send documents
      </li>
      <li>
        to feel assured that RPA has received my documents
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      There are some benefits of a doc upload feature that meet external user needs:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        being able to keep a record of all documents uploaded for a business (including who uploaded them and when), all
        in one place
      </li>
      <li>
        hopefully getting a faster response to any documents sent in because they have reached the correct customer
        service team faster
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      But in general, the drive for designing a doc upload feature comes from internal, not external users. In fact,
      RPAs own feedback on the ICE prototype from farmers and agents has confirmed that continuing to send documents by
      email is just easier for some. It is significantly easier to reply to an email and attach a document than to log
      into a digital service and upload - especially when using a mobile device, as is likely to be the case when
      sending photographs (the commonest type of evidence).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      <i>
        ‘Be clear on how this process makes it quicker and easier for farmers (not just RPA). Some questioned whether
        just sending an email would remain quicker and easier for them.’
      </i>
      <br>[Recommendation from RPA’s Customer Insight Team from interviews with 22 farmers, March 2025]
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Design approach
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      For our initial prototype, we created a scenario for an external user with high permissions (low permissions users
      would not be able to upload or view documents).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Our RPA colleagues confirmed to us that the fundamental business need for the categorisation is for RPA to know,
      from farmers and agents, ‘why are you sending us this and what is it for’. With this in mind, we restructured the
      categorisation journey to try to meet the needs of external users as much as internal users.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We know from all of our previous user research that our users want everything ‘in one place’ and as simple as
      possible. So we changed the order of steps and reworded questions to cut down the number of options users are
      presented with, and put the emphasis on terms we believe, from past research, that users are likelier to
      immediately grasp (like ‘SFI’ and ‘complaint’, compared to ‘submit amendments’).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This means that documents will still capture the necessary tags and go to the same 12 end customer service teams,
      but we tried to make the journey as simple and intuitive for farmers and agents as possible, to encourage them to
      use this feature.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The new system is modular and adaptable, so that the metadata collected can evolve in years to come.
    </p>

    <img src="/public/images/design-history/v11/doc-upload-mapping.png"
      alt="Mural mapping for the categorisation / tagging for document upload" class="design-history">

    <p class="govuk-body">
      It’s important to note, though, that our design scope was constrained, as although we can change the order and
      names of categories that external users see, the back end categories and routing have to fit into the existing
      matrix. The matrix may fit internal users' mental models, because it was designed to fit with RPA’s familiar
      customer relationship management (CRM) system to meet RPA business requirements. But it has not been designed to
      focus on external user needs, so may confuse farmers and agents.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Many of the categories can overlap, for example appeals and complaints and schemes, and grants can fall into
      multiple categories. If a farmer has a capital grant application, do they see that as a grant, or CS? External
      users are extremely likely to struggle to know which category is 'correct'. Also, the CRM itself is built to
      facilitate a confusing existing landscape of multiple funding and grant schemes. A systemic redesign of the
      information architecture for categorisation, including the CRM, could address this problem, and support a system
      that works well for all users. But this would mean changing the way the business is set up. The queues in CRM
      relate to certain teams who are able to work on the documents being uploaded. Changing the queues would mean RPA
      having to restructure.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      Longer term plans
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      One idea, if it can be brought into scope, is auto-triage using process automation or AI. For example, farmers
      could just send a reply to an email request with attachments and the documents would automatically be triaged to
      the right customer service team, or the email request could take farmers to a page in the service pre-categorised
      with what they need to upload, so all they need to do is drag in the documents. For ad-hoc uploads, we could only
      show options based on what schemes someone has enrolled in.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This approach would mean farmers would not need to choose categories themselves, or could at least reduce the
      number of irrelevant options available. This could cut multiple potentially confusing steps out of the journey for
      them and avoid the high risk of a farmer selecting the wrong category, improving customer service efficiency. If
      this could be done, the need for an improved information architecture for categories to meet farmer needs may
      become less critical. The wider team could explore process automation options.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Other ideas to explore include:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        integration of doc upload with two-way messaging
      </li>
      <li>
        end-to-end integration into scheme journeys and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> guidance
      </li>
      <li>
        CRM information architecture restructure, to be more logical and make sense to internal and external users - we
        could help with this
      </li>
      <li>
        scheme-agnostic categories in line with future policy where actions become more important than schemes
      </li>
      <li>
        for users to be able to assign uploads to more than one purpose - for example an invoice could be used as
        evidence for multiple schemes and an appeal
      </li>
      <li>
        Whitehall guidance on what counts as suitable evidence could be standardised
      </li>
      <li>
        including a tag for document type (invoice, receipt, map) could help internal staff in future - this could be
        done with AI
      </li>
      <li>
        reducing the number and length of reference numbers
      </li>
      <li>
        status updates and calls to action in the portal, for example regarding the need to upload evidence in order to
        get paid
      </li>
      <li>
        further improvements to email and letter templates to request evidence and confirm receipt of documents
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
      What we designed
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Within the limited scope we have, we have tried to make the doc upload process as user centred as possible for the
      farmers and agents who RPA want to use this service, while still meeting business requirements.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      For testing, we prototyped 2 journeys:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>
        a farmer who needs to send evidence to support a Countryside Stewardship (CS) capital claim for fencing
      </li>
      <li>
        a farmer who needs to send evidence to support a complaint - we chose this to ensure that we test a situation
        where a farmer is likely to be unhappy as they have a complaint
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Some of the things we have done in our designs, in response to our understanding of user needs:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        We offer an alternative option (email and post) for users who may not find it easy or possible to use an online
        doc upload service
      </li>
      <li>
        Users can search for keywords (to be confirmed exactly what), and can filter by the subject of the upload
      </li>
      <li>
        we have used the <a href="https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/components/multi-file-upload/">Ministry
          of Justice multi file upload component</a> as the basis for our designs of the upload component, because we
        believe that users will prefer being able to upload multiple documents at once given that this is what they
        currently do with attachments via email
      </li>
      <li>
        Users can preview (where possible depending on the document type) and download their document after submitting
        it, which gives them details including who uploaded the document and when, what it’s for, and relevant reference
        numbers
      </li>
      <li>
        Because users will not be able to remove uploaded documents online, we explain this to users
      </li>
      <li>
        Because we could not offer an ‘other’ option of categorisation at any point, we ask users in hint text to select
        the option that fits best
      </li>
      <li>
        We explain the benefits of using the online service to upload to users (to get their documents processed faster)
        in an attempt to motivate them to use this service
      </li>
      <li>
        We remind users to keep their own copies of documents
      </li>
      <li>
        To add to users' information and avoid them wasting time, we provide a link to <a
          href="http://gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> guidance on how to make sure evidence meets requirements, and give guidance
        on what ‘official’ documents cannot be sent online
      </li>
      <li>
        We prototyped updated RPA email requests for evidence, giving users more information to help them to upload the
        correct documents
      </li>
      <li>
        All authorised (high permission) users would get an email notification of someone making an upload to their
        business account
      </li>
    </ul>

    </h2>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        the difference with this (compared to high permission journey which we tested): no upload facility, and no view
        / download facility for individual docs - so it's just a list of uploaded docs
      </li>
      <li>
        apart from the list of docs no other pages in journey (categorisation/upload/view /download) are available so we
        will use the standard page if a low permission user finds themself on any of these:
      </li>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>You do not have permission to access this page</li>
        <li>If you think you need to access this page, you can ask the business to raise your permission level.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        assumption to test (same assumption made in permissions designs): view only users already know they cannot
        upload or view/download docs, without needing this explained to them or a route to request higher permission. If
        this is NOT the case, we could add guidance here to say 'Ask the business to raise your permission level if you
        want to upload, view or download documents.'

      What we tested, outcomes and decisions
    </h2>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      How might we encourage external users to make use of document upload within the service, rather than continuing to
      send documents by email?

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Hypothesis 1:

    <p class="govuk-body">

      The upload button was found quickly by 5 of 7, and view/download options were seen as helpful. There was
      uncertainty over what the dashboard was showing (was it a list of all their correspondence or claims?), but at the
      end of the process users understood their document had been added to that list.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Users feel there are flaws in the existing system of sending in emails in which one can email documents without
      permission and it can take months for documents to reach the right team - problems our design could by its nature

    </p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Design conclusion

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We need to communicate that this is a list of previously uploaded documents (not including any emails or documents
      sent by post - now or ever). Review the heading structure of the dashboard page. Add hint text to the search box.

    <p class="govuk-body">

      There was some positive feedback about the categorisation system, but too much confusion for users to be confident
      when using it. 2 farmers explicitly suggested a smarter system which categorised things for them - the system
      should know what they need to upload, so why should they have to answer these questions? This includes that the
      system should know their reference numbers.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The overlapping nature of the categories (determined by RPA) was very confusing too, especially for those
      unfamiliar with RPS - is a complaint part of a scheme or not? Is a capital grant a grant or a CS capital grant?
    </p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Design conclusion
    </h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We have several ideas to explore to solve this fundamental problem, but these require more work and resource so
      are out of scope at this time.
    </p>

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>
        Avoid categorisation by implementing some form of automatic triage or AI, so all someone has to do is drag a
        document into a reply email (we know from previous research that users may prefer to continue to email). Or they
        could simply drag a document into a pre-categorised page in the service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Content design could support RPA with an information architecture restructure of its categories to make them
        more logical for external users.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      There is high risk people will categorise things wrongly or go back to email and post if we don't solve this
      problem for users. Users are likely to become confused and alarmed and call or email the RPA to check if their
      document has gone to the right place. This in turn risks not solving the problem for RPA - they could end up with
      more calls and emails.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      One idea for the short term could be to give a short explanation of what each category should be used for, but
      this risks adding too much to the page and confusing users even more. We could take the instructions on how to
      find a reference number out of hint text to make this wording more prominent but this would mean deviating from
      the GDS pattern.
    </p>

    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Hypothesis 7:
    </h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      <strong>If</strong> we explain to users that the tagging helps their documents reach a team more quickly,
      and suggest they pick the option that fits best
      <br>
      <strong>Then</strong> they will feel it’s worth choosing a category even if they are not sure it’s the right
      category
      <br>
      <strong>We’ll know this when</strong> users are content to choose a category and do not ask for an 'other'

      Users did choose a category and did not ask for an ‘other’ category, but some users were very confused about
      overlapping categories and plumped for one or the other but were not feeling reassured. In real life, there is a
      high risk of confusion and concern for users, and they may be likely to give up and email, or call the helpline
      for reassurance.

      uploaded when it hasn't.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Users were also confused by the link to Whitehall guidance because it is only a collection and there is no one
      place to find the relevant guidance.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Longer term, with some form of automatic triage, users should only see guidance relevant to the documents they are
      being asked to upload.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      In the short term, review language for consistency around ‘submit’ versus ‘upload'. In setting permissions
      journeys, the language used is ‘submit’, so we may want to use ‘submit documents’ rather than ‘upload documents’.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      There is also a technical issue in that our developers have advised that due to the technology we have to use, by
      uploading a file it will be submitted. This is unlikely to satisfy user needs and risks helpline calls and emails
      to ask for wrongly uploaded documents to be removed (as users cannot remove documents themselves once submitted).
      This approach also means we may not need a ‘check your answers’ page and deviates from the well-tested GDS
      document upload pattern. The PM’s proposed solution is for abandoned files to be purged.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Once the technical issue is clarified, review how we communicate the upload / submission process. Users need to be
      clear on how it works.

      Overall conclusions and next steps for UCD
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The user testing indicates that, as designers predicted, the business solution of digital doc upload risks not
      saving money for RPA in the short term because it is unlikely to solve a whole problem for either external or
      staff users without substantial change to RPA processes.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Our PM’s decision is that these bigger solutions are out of scope for the initial release already agreed with RPA.
      The initial release may not deliver savings but it will lay foundations we can build on over time. Performance
      analysis will give evidence of a need for bigger and better solutions that involve systemic change.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Our next steps (in November 2025) were to iterate short term quick fixes in response to the UR testing, and
      technical updates:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        added a variant for users who have not yet submitted any documents
      </li>
      <li>
        added some ‘handholding’ text at the top of the documents overview page, to explain this is a new feature, what
        it is, and highlight the user benefit - this may only be needed temporarily at launch, but UR testing has found
        our users appreciate clear upfront comms on changes, and did not notice the previous text about the benefit of
        doc upload to them
      </li>
      <li>
        made language consistent throughout ('add documents' or ‘submit documents’, and avoiding ‘upload’ - more

      </li>
      <li>
        refined the search options to explain the user can search for any word or number - the search will cover
        subjects, file names, and submission reference numbers
      </li>
      <li>removed the guidance page on cherished documents and retaining documents for 7 years as this level of detail
        was not found helpful in testing</li>
      <li>
        removed the second link to guidance on Whitehall as it was not found helpful in testing
      </li>
      <li>
        redesigning the upload pages due to updated technical requirements - including a check page to play back the
        metadata categorisation only, and an integrated add / check / submit page, with a variant for if there are no
        added documents
      </li>
      <li>
        other minor content and interaction iterations throughout, for example for clarity
