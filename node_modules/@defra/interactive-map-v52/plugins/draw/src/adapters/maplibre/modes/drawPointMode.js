/**
 * Draw mode for placing a single point: mouse click, or crosshair + Enter/"Add point" button
 * for touch/keyboard. Commits immediately on the first placement — unlike draw_line/draw_polygon,
 * there is no rubber band, no multi-vertex undo, and no "Done" step; the mode self-exits via
 * events.js's onCreate handler once mapbox-gl-draw fires 'draw.create'.
 *
 * Wraps mapbox-gl-draw's own built-in draw_point mode (MapboxDraw.modes.draw_point) for
 * onSetup/onStop/toDisplayFeatures/onTrash — it already creates and tracks the in-progress
 * point feature, and cleans up an uncommitted one on stop. Its onClick/onTap/onKeyUp are
 * overridden outright: the built-in has no placement-veto hook, and treats both Escape and
 * Enter as "abandon and revert to simple_select" — this app needs Enter to place, and a
 * cancel path that goes through draw.cancel like every other mode's does.
