# PluginManifest

Manifest defining a plugin's buttons, panels, controls, icons, API methods, and state.

## Properties

---

### `api`
**Type:** `Object`

Public methods exposed by the plugin for external use. These methods can be called via the plugin instance:

```js
myPlugin.doSomething()
```

Each function receives a [PluginContext](./plugin-context.md) as its first argument, providing access to app state, map provider, services, and more. Additional arguments follow.

```js
{
  doSomething: (context) => {
    console.log(context.appState.breakpoint)
  },
  getValue: (context, id) => {
    return context.pluginState[id]
  }
}
```

---

### `applicationModes`
**Type:** `Object<string, { include?: string[], exclude?: string[] }>`

The [application modes](./plugin-context.md#setapplicationmode) your plugin enters, keyed by mode id, and what each one shows. Your plugin enters and leaves them with `setApplicationMode(id)` and `clearApplicationMode(id)`.

- **`include`** — the mode takes over the interface: everything is hidden except these buttons, panels and controls and your plugin's own items, which are always kept.
- **`exclude`** — these are hidden; everything else stays.
- **No lists** — nothing is hidden; only the `im-o-app--mode-{id}` class is added, for your CSS to respond to.

```js
applicationModes: {
  draw: { include: ['mapStyles', 'mapControls', 'scaleBar'] }
}
```

Several plugins can declare the same mode, e.g. to keep their own control visible in another plugin's mode: their lists combine, and each declaring plugin's own items are kept. The host can then add to, remove from or disable the mode with its [`applicationModes`](../api.md#applicationmodes) option, and any options passed to `setApplicationMode` are applied last.

---

### `buttons`
**Type:** `ButtonDefinition[]`

Button definitions to register in the UI.

Buttons come with pre-built behaviour and styling, including icon support, labels, tooltips, and pressed states. Supports responsive breakpoint configuration.

See [ButtonDefinition](../api/button-definition.md) for full details.

---

### `controls`
**Type:** `ControlDefinition[]`

Custom control definitions to register in the UI.

Use controls for bespoke UI elements that don't fit the button or panel pattern. Controls have no pre-built behaviour or styling—you have full control over rendering and interaction. Supports responsive breakpoint configuration.

See [ControlDefinition](../api/control-definition.md) for full details.

---

### `icons`
**Type:** `IconDefinition[]`

Icon definitions to register in the icon registry.

The icon registry is a singleton shared across all map instances and plugins. Registering an icon with an existing ID will override it. This enforces visual consistency across the application, including when multiple map instances exist on the same page.

See [IconDefinition](../api/icon-definition.md) for full details.

---

### `InitComponent`
**Type:** `ComponentType`

A React/Preact component rendered when the plugin loads. Use this for initialisation logic, side effects, or rendering hidden UI elements.

- Mounted once when the app loads
- Re-renders when [PluginContext](./plugin-context.md) state changes (e.g., `appState`, `pluginState`, `mapState`)
- Typically returns `null` if no visible UI is needed

```jsx
const InitComponent = ({ context }) => {
  const { appState, mapProvider, pluginState } = context

  useEffect(() => {
    // Run side effects when state changes
    console.log('Breakpoint:', appState.breakpoint)
  }, [appState.breakpoint])

  return null
}
```

---

### `keyboardShortcuts`
**Type:** `KeyboardShortcutDefinition[]`

Keyboard shortcut definitions shown in the keyboard shortcuts help panel (opened via <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>?</kbd>). Registering one only adds a row to the help panel — bind the actual key handling separately, e.g. in your plugin's `InitComponent`.

See [KeyboardShortcutDefinition](../api/keyboard-shortcut-definition.md) for full details.

---

### `panels`
**Type:** `PanelDefinition[]`

Panel definitions to register in the UI.

Panels come with pre-built behaviour and styling, including headings, dismissible states, and modal overlays. Supports responsive breakpoint configuration.

See [PanelDefinition](../api/panel-definition.md) for full details.

---

### `reducer`
**Type:** `Object`

Reducer configuration for plugin state management.

```js
{
  initialState: {
    isActive: false
  },
  actions: {
    setActive: (state, isActive) => ({
      ...state,
      isActive
    })
  }
}
```
