/**
 * Central registry for plugins that contribute items to the shared spatial list (see
 * SpatialList.jsx). Plugins register a live item provider — `{ getItems, exclusive? }` —
 * instead of emitting the list event themselves, so exclusive takeover (draw mid-edit) and
 * additive participation (interact's features/markers) both work safely with any number of
 * contributors.
 *
 * `getItems()` returns `{ items, multiselectable, label, focusable }`, called fresh on every
 * recompute rather than snapshotted at registration. `label` becomes the listbox's aria-label;
 * `focusable: false` (draw's vertex/midpoint items) keeps every item out of the Tab order —
 * see SpatialList.jsx. `exclusive: true` claims sole ownership while held (see
 * claimExclusive/releaseExclusive); everything else is additive and gets concatenated
 * together. Providers call notifyItemsChanged whenever their own items would differ — the
 * registry never polls, it only recomputes in response to a caller flagging a change.
