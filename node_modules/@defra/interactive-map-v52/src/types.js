 * specific button). Any plugin may target any panel this way, including one registered by a
 * different plugin. The panel's own content and every control targeting it are ordered together

 * share one implicit tab, labelled with the panel's own `label`. Tabs only render once this
 * produces more than one distinct group — a panel with zero or one tab renders flat, with no
 * tab UI at all. A tab's position and displayed label both come from whichever member ends up
 * first once its own members are ordered by `order`, so there's no separate tab-order property
 * to set. Like `order`, only respected for controls with a `render` component.

 * `<kbd>` tags, e.g. `'<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>'`. If it uses the Alt key,
 * label it per platform (macOS calls it Option, not Alt) — see the shared `isMac()`
 * helper and its use in the app's own core shortcuts.
 *
 * @property {'viewport' | 'listbox' | 'global'} [context='viewport']
 * Which help-panel context this shortcut applies to. Used only to choose the panel's
 * default open tab — it doesn't affect whether the row is shown.
 *
 * @property {string} [group='Navigate']
 * Tab label the shortcut is grouped under in the help panel. Shortcuts sharing a group
 * (case/whitespace-insensitive) appear together under one tab; if every visible shortcut
 * shares one group, the panel renders as a flat list with no tabs.
 *
 * @property {string} id
 * Unique shortcut identifier.
 *
 * @property {string[]} [requiredConfig]
 * App config keys that must all be truthy for the shortcut to appear in the help panel.
 *
 * @property {string} title
 * Accessible title shown in the help panel.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [visuallyHidden=false]
 * When true, the row is hidden from sighted users but stays in the DOM and remains
 * discoverable by assistive technology. Use for a shortcut with no visual affordance to
 * discover it by otherwise — e.g. one whose only effect is a screen reader announcement.

 *
 * @typedef {Object} InteractiveMapConfig
 *
 * @property {'light' | 'dark'} [appColorScheme='light']
 * Application colour scheme.
 *
 * @property {ApplicationModesConfig} [applicationModes]
 * Defines, adjusts or disables application modes, keyed by mode id, e.g. `{ draw: { include: ['search'] } }`.
 * Applied whenever that mode is current, whoever sets it, after the plugins' manifests.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [autoColorScheme=false]
 * Whether to automatically determine the colour scheme based on system preferences.
 *
 * @property {string} [backgroundColor='var(--background-color)']
 * Background color for the map container. A CSS color value.
 *
 * @property {'buttonFirst' | 'hybrid' | 'inline' | 'mapOnly'} [behaviour='buttonFirst']
 * Map interaction behaviour mode.
 *
 * @property {[number, number, number, number]} [bounds]
 * Initial bounds [west, south, east, north]. Equivalent to extent; use whichever matches your map provider's terminology.
 *
 * @property {string} [buttonClass='im-c-open-map-button']
 * CSS class applied to the 'Open map' button.
 *
 * @property {string} [buttonText='Map view']
 * Text content for the button used to open or toggle the map view.
 *

 * Initial center [lng, lat] or [easting, northing] depending on the crs of the map provider.
 *

 * Message displayed when the user's device or browser does not support the component.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [enableFullscreen=false]
 * Whether a toggle fullscreen button is displayed.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [enableMapControls=true]
 * Whether the map controls are displayed — a button that reveals on-screen move,
 * zoom, and precision buttons, plus a target point, typically used to place or
 * select features on the map without a drag gesture. This gives a non-dragging way
 * to operate the map, for anyone who can't perform a drag/pinch gesture (e.g.
 * switch access users) and for voice interfaces such as Voice Control, which can
 * trigger a button click but not a drag. When enabled, enableZoomControls' buttons
 * are hidden to avoid duplication.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [enableZoomControls=true]
 * Whether zoom control buttons are displayed. Not displayed when the interface
 * type is 'touch', or when enableMapControls is enabled.
 *
 * @property {[number, number, number, number]} [extent]
 * Initial extent [minX, minY, maxX, maxY]. Equivalent to bounds; use whichever matches your map provider's terminology.
 *
 * @property {string} [genericErrorText]
 * Fallback error message shown when the map fails to load.
 *
 * @property {{ backLabel?: string, continueLabel?: string, continueEnabledWhen?: function }} [backAndContinue=null]
 * When set, shows Back and/or Continue buttons in the actions bar when the map is fullscreen.
 * Omit `backLabel` to suppress the Back button; omit `continueLabel` to suppress the Continue button.
 * `continueEnabledWhen({ pluginStates, mapState })` is a reactive predicate that controls the enabled
 * state of the Continue button — use this instead of `setContinueEnabled()` for declarative control.
 * In `mapOnly` behaviour the Back button is hidden when there is no browser history to go back to.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [hasExitButton=false]
 * Whether an exit map button is displayed. Only shown when the behaviour is `buttonFirst`
 * or `hybrid` and the map is fullscreen - `mapOnly` has no launcher button or history entry
 * to exit back to, so the exit button is never shown there.
 *
 * @property {number | null} [hybridWidth]
 * Optional breakpoint (in pixels) for hybrid behaviour. Defaults to 'maxMobileWidth' when not set.
 *
 * @property {string} [keyboardHintText]
 * HTML string providing keyboard shortcut instructions for accessibility users, announced via aria-describedby whenever the map viewport gains focus.
 *
 * @property {string} [mapHintText]
 * Visually hidden text, rendered immediately before the map for screen reader users, explaining that it must be focused before keyboard commands work. Prefixed with mapLabel, so multiple maps on one page can be told apart.
 *
 * @property {string} [mapLabel='Interactive map']
 * Accessible label for the map, announced by screen readers. Also prefixed onto mapHintText, so give each map on a page a distinct label.
 *
 * @property {string} [mapControlsHintText]
 * Visually hidden text describing the map controls button, appended to keyboardHintText when enableMapControls is true.
 *
 * @property {MapProviderDescriptor} [mapProvider]
 * A factory function that returns a map provider instance (e.g. maplibreProvider()).
 *
 * @property {'small' | 'medium' | 'large'} [mapSize='small']
 * Visual size variant of the map.
 *
 * @property {MapStyleConfig} [mapStyle]
 * Map style configuration.
 *
 * @property {string} [mapViewQueryParam='mv']
 * URL query parameter used to control fullscreen/hybrid/buttonFirst state.
 * Override if the default value clashes with an existing parameter on your page.
 *
 * @property {'sync' | 'readOnly' | 'none'} [urlPosition='sync']
 * Controls how map center and zoom interact with the page URL.
 *   - `'sync'` — reads on load and writes on pan/zoom (default)
 *   - `'readOnly'` — seeds the initial view from the URL but never writes back
 *   - `'none'` — ignores the URL entirely; use when you don't want the user's pan/zoom to be persisted or shared
 *
 * @property {MarkerConfig[]} [markers]
 * Initial markers to display on the map.
 *
 * @property {Partial<SymbolDefaults>} [symbolDefaults]
 * App-wide defaults for symbol appearance. Merged onto the hardcoded defaults in symbolDefaults.js.
 * Values cascade: symbolDefaults.js → constructor symbolDefaults → symbol registration → marker creation.
 *
 * @property {[number, number, number, number]} [maxExtent]
 * Maximum viewable extent [west, south, east, north].
 *
 * @property {number} [maxMobileWidth=640]
 * Maximum viewport width (in pixels) considered to be a mobile device.
 *
 * @property {number} [maxZoom]
 * Maximum zoom level.
 *
 * @property {number} [minDesktopWidth=835]

 * @property {string} [pageTitle='Map view']
 * Page title text used when the map is fullscreen.
 *
 * @property {number} [panDelta=100]
 * Distance (in pixels) to pan the map during standard pan interactions.
 *
 * @property {PluginDescriptor[]} [plugins]
 * Plugins to load.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [manageHistoryState=true]
 * Whether the library should manage browser history state (pushState/replaceState) when opening and closing the map.
 * Set to `false` in SPA frameworks (e.g. React Router, Docusaurus) that intercept history API calls.
 * When `false`, listen to `APP_OPENED` and `APP_CLOSED` events and manage navigation in your router instead.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [preserveStateOnClose=false]
 * Whether to preserve the map state when closed via back button or exit button.
 * When true, the map is hidden but not destroyed, preserving markers, zoom, etc.
 * Useful for list/map toggle scenarios. Only applies to 'hybrid' and 'buttonFirst' behaviours.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [readMapText=false]
 * Whether map text labels can be selected and read aloud by assistive technologies.
 *
 * @property {ReverseGeocodeProviderDescriptor} [reverseGeocodeProvider]
